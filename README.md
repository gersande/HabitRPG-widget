HabitRPG Widget for Wordpress
======

This project was designed to be used as a widget on your website to show your [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com) character and some stats on your own personal website.

* [Installation instructions by Gersande for this repository](http://gersande.com/display-habitrpg-as-a-user-badge-not-the-whole-rpg-on-a-wordpress-site-on-your-own-server/)
* [Original installation instructions, also has instructions for how to create iframes with this code](https://github.com/pipcorona/HabitRPG-widget)

The future! 
======

* Turn this into a Wordpress Plugin (right now this code has a dependency on another plugin for it to work, which sucks. I need to figure out how to run this code without needing that other plugin).
* Fix the problem where the widget refuses to display more than once.
